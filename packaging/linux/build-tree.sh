# Assembles the file tree that becomes the deb and the rpm - run on a Linux CI
# runner, once per architecture.
#
# The package is deliberately self-contained: it carries its own CPython (from
# python-build-standalone) and its own Node, because "which Python does your distro
# ship" is exactly the support question a packaged product exists to remove. The
# cost is size; the win is that one artifact behaves the same on Debian, Ubuntu,
# Fedora and RHEL. Everything lands under /opt/tel-agent, and the venv is created
# at its final absolute path so it needs no relocation tricks.
#
# Usage: packaging/linux/build-tree.sh <amd64|arm64> <staging-dir>
# Expects the repository root as the working directory, with web/ already built
# (`npm run build` - the standalone bundle is what gets shipped).
